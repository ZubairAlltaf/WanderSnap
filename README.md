# WanderSnap 🌍📸

WanderSnap is a learning-focused Flutter app where users can post images of the places they've visited, along with descriptions. Other users can like these posts and explore shared moments from around the world.

What makes this app unique is its dual-database architecture: it uses both **Firebase Realtime Database** and **Cloud Firestore** side-by-side within the same project. This allows learners and developers to **compare their behavior, structure, and performance in real-time**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📷 Post images of places you've visited
- 📝 Add captions or descriptions to your posts
- ❤️ Like posts from other users
- 🔄 Realtime updates using **Firebase Realtime Database**
- 🔥 Same features mirrored using **Cloud Firestore**
- 📚 Side-by-side implementation to learn the difference between Realtime Database and Firestore
- 🧪 Clean UI for easy comparison and interaction

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This app was built purely as a **learning project** to:

- Understand how to integrate both Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore in a single Flutter app
- Learn about real-time syncing and structure differences
- Improve skills in Flutter development and backend integration

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** — Cross-platform mobile app framework
- **Firebase Authentication** — For user login and signup
- **Firebase Realtime Database** — To store and sync post data in real-time
- **Cloud Firestore** — To mirror the data in a more structured way
- **Firebase Storage** — For uploading and retrieving user-posted images

📚 Learnings & Comparison
Inside the app, you'll find that each feature has been implemented twice:

Once using Realtime Database

Once using Firestore

You can compare:

Data structure

Performance
